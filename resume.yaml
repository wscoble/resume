      The work I did at findhelp was focused on facilitating rapid development against external integrations. It was said that without my contribution in this area, we would not have been able to integrate successfully with Epic.
    highlights:
      - Built Epic FHIR integration mock to generate constant load for real-time debugging of FHIR integrations using Locust and Flask.
      - Because testing data was generated in real-time, there was a rapid deploy, test, analyze flow that saved the development teams weeks of debugging and back-and-forth with Epic.
